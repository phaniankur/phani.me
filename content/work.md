### My work at Craveo

I am responsible for ensuring our web and mobile applications run smoothly. I am experienced in building highly scalable mobile and web applications ensuring testing, performance optimization, security, and analytics.

#### Price Comparison

I have built the [Craveo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bybrisk.strike.app&hl=en_IN) which has near **5L+ downloads** on playstore, built on React Native. It featured scalable functionalities like *Over-The-Air updates*(OTA) using codepush, push notifications using Firebase, Force update apps, in app reviews, etc. 

I had written few backend services on **Node JS, Express JS**. I had written a script to send bulk push notifications to users. Supported sending 1000 concurrent notifications in 1 minute.

#### Remy
Our current product [Remy](https://chat.craveo.in) is built on **React Native Expo**. It is a cross platform application that run on Web, Android & iOS.

I have written a mailer script in **Python** to send bulk emails to users with **AWS SES**.

I am really interested and currently exploring AI/ML and building agentic workflows. I have built a mini project in **RAG** architecture to convert NLP queries to SQL queries [github](https://github.com/phaniankur/d-bee). *It is a WIP.*
